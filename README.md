# Project Templates

## Description

This is an application that creates "templates" of boilerplate for a new
application. It can also be used to add additional files to an existing
application.

There are similar projects that already exist. The most interesting ones are the
Python applications. Ultimately I'd like to have a single static binary that can
easily be compiled for multiple platforms without a lot of dependencies. In the
short term I'm building a prototype with Ruby because that's the best support
language for extending the cloud-based IDE I use at work.
